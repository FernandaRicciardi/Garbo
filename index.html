He participated on both sides of the war without firing a single shot. Juan was a double agent for the British, performing so well that they nicknamed him for the enigmatic actress Greta Garbo.
                <br><br>
                He created an imaginary network of twenty-seven secret agents that generated a wealth of information, which the enemy firmly believed. His masterpiece was to trick Hitler into thinking that the Allied invasion of Occupied Europe was going to happen very far from where it actually did.

                        According to his own testimony, when the Spanish Civil War broke out he followed the ethical code instilled in him by his father, who had died a few years earlier. Juan decided to avoid the front lines and not participate in the conflict. This decision led him to remain hidden from the Republican forces for two years. Finally, in 1938, he enlisted with them only to then escape from the Republican trenches, changing sides and joining the Nationalist faction.

                        In September 1939 England had declared war on Germany.

                        After the victory of Franco, Juan and Araceli decided to contribute to ending the Second World War by helping the United Kingdom as much as possible against the Axis powers. One January day in 1941, he presented himself without further ado at the British embassy in Madrid.
                        <br><br>
                        But Juan was rejected several times by the British Military Intelligence Services (the MI5) and ended up being recruited in Madrid by the Abwehr, the German Intelligence Service. He was given Alaric as his code name, as the Germans were prompted by their belief in his small yet nonexistent spy network within England.
                        <br><br>
                        Unable to get real information for either faction, Alaric decided to invent it: he transmitted his messages from Lisbon pretending to be in Britain, using maps, dictionaries of military terms, press releases and the Blue Guide of maritime navigation, whatever he could find in bookstores, news kiosks and libraries.

                        In April of 1942, thanks to Araceli González’s intervention before the US embassy Juan Pujol was finally recruited by MI5 and transferred to London. He was baptised by the British with the code name Garbo, the best actor in the world. With Thomas Harris, his most direct boss, he expanded his fictitious network to 27 operative agents, in order to supply false information to the Germans.

                        In this way, Garbo influenced the decision making of the German High Command, which trusted him even after the end of the war. Highlighted -among other achievements- is his decisive contribution to Operation Fortitude, a much wider poisoning manoeuvre whose objective was to convince the Germans that the landing in France would take place in the port of Calais and not on the Normandy beaches. The Germans accepted this statement, thus fulfilling the objective of Operation Fortitude.
                        <br><br>
                        To such an extent they trusted Garbo’s information that during July and August they maintained two armoured divisions and nineteen infantry divisions in the Calais Pass in anticipation of an invasion.
                        <br><br>
                        This gave the Allies precious time to establish their bridgehead and, as British intelligence asserts, Garbo’s intervention in the battle of Normandy really tipped the scales in his favour in World War II.

                        Juan Pujol García was the only participant of the Second World War decorated by both sides, receiving the highest honours: he was appointed <strong>Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)</strong> and received the German <strong>Iron Cross</strong>.

                        Juan Pujol and his family settled in Venezuela, where his daughter María Eugenia was born. After a series of hard economic reverses his wife, Araceli, did not adapt to the new life, which motivated the separation of the couple. Both Pujol and Araceli remade their lives, with the collaboration of the allies.
                        <br><br>
                        In Venezuela, Pujol taught English to local employees of the Shell oil company. Later he opened a stationery store and after his marriage with Carmen Cilia Álvarez he had three more children, María Elena –who died very young–, Carlos Miguel and Juan Carlos.

                        Araceli returned to Madrid with her children and remarried with Edward Kreisler, an American businessman who had been a double of Rodolfo Valentino, was well-connected with Hollywood and had excellent political and diplomatic connections. Both founded the Kreisler art gallery.

                        Juan Pujol managed to get the British military intelligence to spread false news of his death, of which several versions circulated: for example, that it took place in Angola or Mozambique, and that it was, either by malaria or by snake bite.

                        This would have been the end of the story, if it were not for the fact that, in 1984, British writer, politician and military historian, Nigel West, pseudonym of Rupert Allason, discovered that Garbo was still alive and together they wrote a book in which they unveiled this story to the world.
                        <br><br>
                        After his reappearance, Pujol received all kinds of honours in England and was able to meet with former colleagues of MI5. Finally he was reunited with the children of his first marriage, who had considered him dead until then. Later, both families met.
