This is the first project for the freeCodeCamp **Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)**.

I've decided to talk about the Spanish spy Juan Pujol, code-named Garbo by the British Military Intelligence Services. Juan lived a lie that helped win World War II. He participated on both sides of the war without firing a single shot.

For this project, I used only HTML and CSS. I worked on two different **animations**, one simulates a typewriter and the other colourises the picture of the banner (manipulating the grayscale filter). I also used a **drop cap effect** that was accomplished by using the pseudo-elements **::before/::after** and some pseudo-classes to set up the screen reader function correctly. I used **variables** to define some colours too.

Cheers! :wave:
